This part of the project deals with scalable model deployment. A deep learning timeseries weather prediction model is trained and then deployed using the Flask backend, and containerised with Docker. 

The files enable you to create an image and then run the docker container, which can then be deployed locally, on-premise, or to the cloud. Kubernetes services can be used to autoscale the number of containers and adjust to traffic using GCP GKE, AWS EKS or Azure AKS.
